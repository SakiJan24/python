In this repository you are going to find a series of notebooks where I have done Data Analytics projects, some of them are smaller some are bigger. 
- The bikes notebook is a little data visualization of a Data Set of bike rentals.
- The collisions dataset is about collisions of vehicles in the New York City, this uses PySpark because of the size of the dataset.
- The arrests dataset is about arrests in NYC.
